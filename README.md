# gosh

I have a lot of small pieces of random code that I find useful from time to time.

Right now, all of it is private, but I've often wanted to make parts of it public,
either to show something, or to allow others to make use of something.

The idea of this repository is to provide a place to put it all.

**NOTE**: I provide no backwards compatibility guarentees.

**NOTE**: I provide no other guarentees about quality, usability, or security.

Depend on this at your own risk.
